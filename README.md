# Caesar's code

Python implementation of Caesar cipher. In cryptography, a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
